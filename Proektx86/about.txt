have been solved(last commit):
	1)users command parser
		--run all --- is working well
		--run number(ex run 2) -- will be in next commit
		--show  (ex show %eax, or show int1)  - is working good
		--step - will be in next commit
		--report - do not work, can you give me advice how to make it
			{i have an idea to do it in such way:
				to creat file report.txt
				to write into it such things:
					text of as-ler programme
					and after each command write changes
					(example : movl $4,%eax
					%eax=...>>%eax=4
					pushl %eax
					stack(number)=...)
			and in the end of report writedown 
			"After finishig program we have %eax=... etc"
			} 
			this part will be easy, and if you say that it is ok
			i'll commit it.
		--change -- will be in next commit
		help	--is working well
		exit  --is working well
	else
	2)you can choose as-ler file  which you want to open
	3)little changes in process_commands

cheks
	stack is working well
	addl,movl,popl,pushl,jmp,je,ja,jb -- are working well
	


problems:
	1)i have problems with 
		loop -- it does not work well (will fixed in next commit)
	2)i would like to have stack report(for example to wright last 10 things in stack)
	but i do not know how to solve this problem
	3)problem with calling printf and scanf have not been solved yet(i'll try to write somthing untill next sunday, 
	if i do not solve it, i'll ask you how to do it)
